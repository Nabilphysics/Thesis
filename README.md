Requirement for the Degree of Master of Science

Highly precise devices are required for extensive, modern and sophisticated experimental research work. Two devices have been developed to control the laser and rotational stage. In those Embedded systems AVR Microcontroller has been used where the programming language was C++. The remote control has been developed for the laser controller and an external mechanical device has been designed to mount a stepper motor with the rotational stage. The measured Accuracy for the controller of laser and rotational stage has been found to be 3% and 5% respectively.
